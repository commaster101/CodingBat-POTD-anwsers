# Instructions  

Given a string, if one or both of the first 2 chars is 'x', return the string without those 'x' chars, and otherwise return the string unchanged.  This problem is harder than it looks!

  ## Test Cases
  1. withoutx2("xHi") -> "hi"
  2. withoutx2("Hxi") -> "hi"
  3. withoutx2("Hi") -> "hi"
