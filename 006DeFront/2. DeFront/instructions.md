# Instructions  

Given a string, return a version without the first 2 chars.  Except keep the first char if it is 'a' and keep the second char if it is 'b'.  The string may be any length.  This problem is harder than it looks.

  ## Test Cases
  1. deFront("Hello") -> "llo"
  2. deFront("java") -> "va"
  3. deFront("away") -> "aay"
